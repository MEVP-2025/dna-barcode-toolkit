1. Data Preprocessing
    Standardizes read identifiers in R1/R2 FASTQ files
    Matches barcodes with reference database and trims adapters
    Applies quality filtering based on configurable parameters
        Select Species to Analyze
            CypDL  ZpDL  xworm
            Maximum mismatches for ZpDL : 3 mismatches

2. Sequence Assembly & Length Filtering
    Tool: PEAR v0.9.6 for assembly
    Merges overlapping paired-end reads (R1/R2) into single contigs
    Converts FASTQ format to FASTA format
    Applies length filtering with 200bp minimum threshold

3. Species Assignment & Classification
    Creates BLAST database from mitochondrial D-loop reference sequences
    Performs BLAST search against NCBI reference database
        Upload NCBI reference file
    Applies intelligent species assignment rules with quality control
        * title *
        Mitochondrial sequences with â‰¥ 0 % identity
    Separates sequences by assigned species into individual FASTA files

4. Multiple Sequence Alignment
    Tool: MAFFT v7.505 with auto-selection strategy
    Aligns sequences within each species group separately
    Requires minimum 2 sequences per species for alignment
    Generates aligned FASTA files for downstream haplotype analysis

5. Duplicate Analysis & Haplotype Identification
    Identifies identical sequences and counts their occurrence frequency
    Separates high-frequency sequences (potential haplotypes) from unique sequences
    Applies configurable copy number threshold for haplotype detection
    Generates separate files for common haplotypes and rare variants

6. Location-Haplotype Table Generation
    Parses haplotype data to extract geographic location information
    Creates a cross-tabulation matrix of locations vs. haplotypes
    Counts haplotype frequency at each sampling location
    Generates CSV format table for population genetic analysis
